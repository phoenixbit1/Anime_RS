# Anime Recommendation System using Neural Networks

## Description
This project aims to design a neural network-based anime recommendation system by comparing four distinct models:
1. Solely using genre and score.
2. Incorporating genre, score, and latest release time.
3. Merging explanations of why an anime is recommended along with genre and score.
4. A model integrating genre, score, release time, and explanation of why the anime is recommended.

The hypothesis suggests that the fourth model will be the best fit for a recommendation system.
